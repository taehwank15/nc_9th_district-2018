# Question 1

There were `r dem_support` respondents who supported the Democratic candidate.

There were `r more_rep` more respondents who favored the Republican candidate than who were Undecided.

There are two gender variables (gender and gender_combined). There are `r gender_diff` individuals for whom these variables have different values.

There are `r white_diff` respondents listed as “White” under race_eth who are not listed as “White” under file_race_black.

The first response of Dem came `r response_gap` minutes (rounded to the nearest minute) before the first response of Rep
